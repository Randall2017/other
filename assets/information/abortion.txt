<br><br>The right to life is one of the most fundamental rights any American can posses, enabling one to relish in their endowed opportunity to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,” as stated in one of our great nation’s founding documents, The Declaration of Independence. As unborn children are not an exception to the scope with which these rights apply and are justifiably entitled to them, the S.C.A.R.E. Party wholeheartedly advocates for a considerable ban on abortions, supporting measures to limit the time frame in which a woman can receive one, as well as those to eliminate the use of taxpayer funding for these procedures.
<br><br><b>Legal Time Frame</b>
<br><br>We believe it is in the best interest of the United States and its citizens for abortions to only be legal within the first month of a woman’s pregnancy, unless it was due to rape, incest, or puts the woman’s life in danger, in which women with these circumstances can legally receive an abortion at any time during her pregnancy. Since a child’s heartbeat appears after the first month of pregnancy, restricting any abortion after this point effectively prevents a legitimate, human baby from being inhumanly killed by an abortion procedure, as well as lowers the chances of the mother being harmed as well. For those special cases, we believe no women who experienced trauma as a cause of her pregnancy, or is at risk of death because of it, should be prevented from receiving this procedure, as she should not have to put herself in danger, or face constant reminder of said traumatic incident, that a limited legal time frame would allow for. Additionally, our great nation is in clear favor of restrictions on the legality of abortions, with more than 44% of Americans agreeing abortion is morally wrong, according to Pew Research Center (Lipka and Gramlich), and 51% of women surveyed by the Center for Gender Equality believing abortion should either never be permitted, or only be permitted for rape, incest, or life endangerment (Schwarzwalder). That being said, in our pro-life supportive nation, our party’s stances on this issue will be acting in favor a large percentage of our people, and delivering on our promise to prohibit abortions to what is within a humane amount of time. 
<br><br><b>Taxpayer Funding</b>
<br><br>We also believe in cutting taxpayer funding for these procedures, as taxpayers are currently accountable for 24% of abortion costs, or roughly the cost of 250,000 abortions a year. This is too much, and thus, we support measures similar to the Hyde Amendment which prevents taxpayer funded Medicaid from funding abortions, with some exceptions, similar to ours for our legal timeline. By keeping these policies in place, we can reduce the amount of taxpayer money directed toward health care. Overall, we look to coincide with the The UN Declaration of the Rights of the Child, which states “the child, by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth,” (National Right to Life). By reducing the amount of time a woman within which a woman receive an abortion and cutting taxpayer funding, we will enable this treasured principle to be a reality for as many unborn American children as possible. 
<br><br><b>Maternal Health</b>
<br><br>Abortion is extremely prevalent in the US, with our country’s abortion rate ranking among the highest of developed countries, with nearly 1 in 4 pregnancies ending in this way. This cruel procedure has many dangerous risks and negative effects, including, but not limited to, heavy bleeding, damage to internal organs, pelvic inflammatory disease, eating disorders, depression, endometriosis and death (Guttmacher Institute). With this plethora of problems that could plague a woman following her abortion, we believe that we should focus on improving maternal health care. To do this, we will work to improve sanitary systems, well equipped maternal health facilities, training of involved medical staff, and adoption services. Countries in which these aspects are lacking or are without abortion restrictions have just seen their maternal mortality rates rise, with, for example, South Africa’s MMR nearly doubling from 1990 to 2008 following its legalization of abortion in 1997. However, according to WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and the World Bank, the four countries that reduced their maternal mortality rate the most between 1990 and 2008, the Maldives, Romania, Iran and Bhutan, all had bans on abortion (National Right to Life). Thus, the S.C.A.R.E. Party believes that our country will be able to dramatically decrease its MMR through beneficial methods without fully legalizing abortion, overall leading to more life for babies and the women that carry them overall.
