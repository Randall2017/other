When it comes to the economy, the S.C.A.R.E. Party knows that putting America First means bringing success and prosperity to the American people. Prosperity, and the opportunity to achieve it, is essential to citizens’ freedom and their ability to build their own lives. The more prosperous the nation is, the freer the people are. And the freer the people are, the more prosperous the nation is. Under the Trump administration, the government has taken meaningful strides towards growing the American economy, with positive results to show for them. But the S.C.A.R.E. Party aims to do even better. We plan to implement exactly what our name describes: Responsible Economics. In order to achieve a fast-growing economy and thus a more affluent America, the S.C.A.R.E. Party advocates lower taxes, less government regulation, and the Right-to-Work. 
<br><br><b>Taxes</b>
<br><br>The American people today pay taxes that are far too high to fund a government that does far too little. They are a burden on the people, who have the right to keep the money that they earn. The S.C.A.R.E. Party proposes income tax cuts for every citizen: low, middle, and high-income. These cuts will stimulate demand by keeping more money in consumers’ pockets. With more money comes more spending -- this is imperative, because consumer spending drives 70 percent of economic growth. In turn, this creates more jobs, as businesses increase production to meet higher demand. Low income taxes are a win-win policy that help both individual Americans as well as the national economy.
<br><br>The S.C.A.R.E. Party also believes in cutting payroll taxes. Lower payroll taxes spur economic growth, specifically through the effect of creating jobs. The tax savings that companies receive allows them to reduce prices, which increases demand and thus necessitates hiring more employees; raise wages, which increases consumer spending and demand; or use the savings to hire more workers. In fact, a report by the Congressional Budget Office concludes that every $1 million in payroll tax cuts creates 13 new jobs. 
<br><br>Further, the S.C.A.R.E. Party believes that in order to put America First, U.S. corporations have to be able to compete globally. High corporate taxes hinders this ability and thus encourages companies to move abroad, as well as discourages their investment. This leads to less job creation at home and lower wages for Americans. Therefore, the S.C.A.R.E. Party proposes lower corporate tax rates. Lowering corporate tax rates increases the number of investment projects that are economically worthwhile, and the more private investment that takes place, the higher the level of capital is. A low corporate tax rate will spur economic growth as the economy moves into a new steady state with a higher GDP.
<br><br><b>Business Regulation</b>
<br><br>Americans cannot thrive to their full economic potential if the opportunities of capitalism are limited by strict government regulations. The S.C.A.R.E. Party believes that in a free country, the government has little right to interfere with the practices of private businesses. According to independent estimates, business regulation costs the nation a staggering amount of money: more than $2 trillion dollars annually. In the past 15 years, with the number of regulatory burdens growing, the cost of red tape (excessive regulation) has increased by at least $200 billion. About $70 billion of that comes at the cost of taxpayers. Furthermore, a study for the Small Business Administration found that regulations add $10,585 in costs per employee. These absurd costs have been the result of new regulations introduced in recent years, including the EPA’s Clean Power Plan, excessively prescriptive food production standards, Dodd-Frank financial regulations, and network neutrality rules dictated by the Federal Communications Commission. The S.C.A.R.E. Party proposes drastically reducing or removing these regulations, as well as regulations regarding employment and labor law requirements, so that American businesses have the opportunity to flourish in a freer U.S. economy.
<br><br><b>Right-to-Work</b>
<br><br>The S.C.A.R.E. Party fully supports the rights of states to enact Right-to-Work Laws. No worker should feel compelled to join a union. Moreover, a number of scholarly analyses published since 2010 by economist Richard Vedder and his coauthors have proved that there is a causal, positive relationship between the presence of a Right-to-Work law and economic growth. States with Right-to-Work laws attract and sustain businesses at a higher rate than states without them -- 9.2% compared to just 2.1%, between 2001 and 2012. The economic advantages of Right-to-Work laws earn the support of the S.C.A.R.E. Party and align with the party’s America First philosophy.
