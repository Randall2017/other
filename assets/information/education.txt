Education is critical to our society, and every citizen is entitled to one. Though many see it as a place to learn English and arithmetic, it also teaches our young citizens patriotism, morals, and acceptable social behavior. However, our current system does not accurately prepare our students for life outside of school, and, due to overreaching federal mandates, provides no options for parents who may wish for different lessons. Therefore, our primary goal with our education policy is choice. Choice for parents and students, choice for states and schools. We propose a near complete repeal of federal mandates on schools, aside from those absolutely required for safety and learning. 
<br><br>The decision to give decision-making power back to the states and the people is not unorthodox—it was done this way for two centuries. However, recent policy, such as the common core, has changed this. Though technically voluntary, the Obama Administration, in its “Race to the Top” signature legislation, has rewarded states for the adoption of the program by granting them additional points in the funding lottery system. This severely disadvantages states that wish to maintain control over the education system to better personalize it for the people of their area. 
<br><br>When comparing the performance of American students to that of international students. American students are ranked 24th in English, but lag behind at 38th for mathematics. That’s below average. For the richest country in the world, this is a disgraceful standing. Something isn’t working. We believe that root cause of this is an outdated system, one which doesn’t prioritize the skills of the future because it has no incentive to do so. Therefore, we turn to the viable alternatives: technical and magnet schools. Our education policy revolves around a system of tuition vouchers to help parents pay the tuition of specialized schools, as well as privatizing the system, re-adding incentive for success. Technical schools only cost ¼ that of a college tuition, yet provide the skills that are necessary and helpful for an ever-changing society and well-paying jobs.
<br><br>Furthermore, as court cases such as Edwards v. Aguillard (1987) and Lee v. Weisman (1992) have shown, there may not be an intermingling of church and state, including in public schools. Approximately 88% of school-age children believe religion has some importance, and many parents may want their children to receive religious schooling, yet, with our current funding model, cannot afford to do so. We view this to be a restriction of religious freedom and exercise in and of itself. To rectify this situation, we intend to expand the charter and magnet school grants to cover private, religious schools of all faiths. This would provide options for parents, the people who know what’s best for their child.
<br><br>Though we propose repealing many mandates, including incentivizing states to reduce the number of standardized tests, we support safety and learning above all. For this reason, we find it necessary to require up-to-date immunizations for all school age children, pursuant to the recommendations set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mass vaccinations are the reason for the wide-scale eradication of disease that, only a few centuries or decades ago, could ravage society. Through the immunization process, which bears no link to autism, students can gain protection against influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, polio, and dozens of other life-threatening diseases. Not everyone is fortunate to have working immune systems that can fight off illness or handle vaccinations, and through herd immunity, we can protect them, to ensure their access to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Though we stand for parent and community-level level choices, this is a decision that truly calls for federal mandate in the name of putting the good of the country first.
