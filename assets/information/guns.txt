The 2nd Amendment gives Americans the right to bear arms, something that the S.C.A.R.E. Party is in support of. This is a right that American people have held since the creation of the country and the passage of the Constitution and Bill of Rights, and that is a tradition that needs to be upheld. This right allows people to protect themselves and their family from any dangers that they may face, as well as their land and belongings. Taking away this right would do more harm than good in the long run, as the vast majority of incidents involving gun violence involve individuals with mental illnesses, and taking the opportunity to defend themselves away from everyone or heavily restricting this right would be unjust. 
<br><br><b>Self Defense</b>
<br><br>The 2nd Amendment first and foremost allows Americans to defend themselves, something that the S.C.A.R.E. Party finds absolutely necessary. Annually, the number of times that individuals use a gun to defend themselves can be as high as 2.5 million, and those who have a firearm are proven to be less likely to be injured by an assailant, showing the value of this right. Since the number of gun owners has doubled, people are also safer from violent acts including gun homicides and other sorts of gun violence, the total number of these incidents being over half as less since the 1980s. Although much of today’s gun control legislation seeks to protect the majority of Americans from irresponsible and dangerous individuals wielding guns, it is also hurting those who are responsible and safe gun wielders who need to defend themselves on a smaller scale. 
<br><br><b>Concealed Weapons</b>
<br><br>Something the S.C.A.R.E. Party supports is concealed weapons, due to their ability to allow the average responsible citizen to protect themselves from the dangers that face them. This would also better society because concealed weapons are proven to reduce the rates of murder, rape, aggravated assault, and robbery. They also help to stop mass shootings before they get out of hand. The S.C.A.R.E. Party would also like to expand the ideas and goals of the Concealed Carry Act, which if spread to the rest of the United States, would allow law abiding citizens to carry concealed weapons with them, making their personal protection and protection from threats around them a top priority.
<br><br><b>Gun Control Legislation</b>
<br><br>The S.C.A.R.E. Party is also against an increase in gun control legislation, including background checks, banning assault weapons, and giving the government more power than necessary. Background checks are an invasion of privacy that allows personal information about a person, including their name, mental health history, address, criminal history, and more to be put into government databases. The National Shooting Sports Foundation says that the assault weapons are generally no more powerful than hunting rifles. The weapons are also used mostly for sport and hunting, and almost 32% of gun owners own weapons like these for hunting, using the guns and sights for game only. Finally, the S.C.A.R.E. Party is against the use of gun control legislation as it gives too much power to the government. One of the main reasons that the 2nd Amendment was put into the Bill of Rights was to let the colonists protect themselves against the possible threat of the tyrannical British government, and giving the United States government would only bring that threat back.
