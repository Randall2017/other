Foreign Policy has been an important issue in the United States. There have been growing tensions between the United States and other foreign countries and allies with the rise of military advancements and weapons in these nations. Currently, the Trump administration has been working to grow a better relationship with Russia that would ultimately benefit our involvement with other countries in the near future. Although Trump has the right motive in attempting to improve our current association with Russia, he has been approaching this process in a fallacious way. The S.C.A.R.E. Party plans on handling our vital relationship with Russia in an improved way. Along with our continuous hostile relationship with Russia, our involvement with the North Koreans has also grown into an adverse alliance with one another. The S.C.A.R.E. Party acknowledges North Korea’s burgeoning nuclear weapons program and we have developed a plan in maneuvering this nonstop issue of the advancements of nuclear weapons in North Korea. 
<br><br><b>Russia</b>
<br><br>The United States has always had an ominous relationship with Russia. The Cold War revealed our malicious association with each other. Throughout this time, both Russia and the United States were competing with one another in the arms race and working to further their development of nuclear weapons such as the atomic and hydrogen bomb. During the Cold War, there was a growing expectancy of a threatening attack by the Russians. Americans lived in fear especially during the height of the Cold War, knowing that there was a possibility of undergoing a nuclear attack. The S.C.A.R.E. Party plans to rebuild a more amiable friendship with Russia. At the moment, we have all seen Trump along with his family members who have continuously seem to be involved in scandals with the Russian government. Their responses to these alleged pieces of information and how they handled the scandals were not what American citizens were expecting of the President and his family. The S.C.A.R.E. Party plans to display a more improved manner and behavior toward the American people and the Russian government in order to finally develop a friendlier relationship with Russia. The goal in developing a more affable alliance with Russia is a critical matter that The S.C.A.R.E. Party finds vital in order to provide a safe world for people to live in along with our relationship with other nations. An unstable alliance with Russia will result in a more perilous world that we’ll be living in.
<br><br><b>North Korea</b>
<br><br>North Korea is repeatedly depicted as a threat to the United States with their new advancements in successfully testing and firing missiles, and creating one of their most powerful nuclear bombs yet of 250 kilotons. In order to protect our resources, citizens, and country we must enlarge our military and advance our process in developing more weapons to combat these threats from North Korea. Our current relationship with North Korea is unstable and can possibly lead us into World War III. North Korea is unwilling to negotiate in order to address this issue. The S.C.A.R.E. Party believes that a threat comparable to the one that North Korea displays in the United States should not be ignored and must be taken into serious consideration. Similar to the Cold War, if we see a continuing menace from North Korea that escalates any further, the United States will be compelled to act against any threat. 
<br><br>The United State’s previous allies continues to trail us in our foreign policy today. It is because of the turnouts in the Korean War and the actions that occurred in the War that brought us to where we are today in foreign policy with North Korea. These grudges that are held between our country and North Korea requires us to strengthen our armed forces and military equipment. The S.C.A.R.E. Party intends to commence a development of stronger weapons, more strategic tactics in battling, and an increase in military size. We must be prepared to react quickly to any possible attacks made by North Korea in the near future. In order to protect our country from the dangers of North Korea, we will initiate advancements in military technology and weapons by funding programs in relation to these goals.
