Regarding healthcare and drug policies, the S.C.A.R.E. Party believes that American citizens should be independent and are capable of making their own informed decisions. Nowadays the tension over whether or not healthcare should be universal has increased. The S.C.A.R.E. Party believes that healthcare is an important issue for each and every American citizen, as well as the nation as a whole. Although we acknowledge its importance, healthcare should not be mandatory for Americans. There has also been controversy regarding how the United States should decide the consequences of drug-related crimes. Due to an increase in crime rates, the S.C.A.R.E. Party believes that drug crimes must have firm punishments in order to ensure every American’s safety. The American people’s safety and health is what matters the most in order to live a blessed life.
<br><br><b>Affordable Care Act</b>
<br><br>In 2010, healthcare in the United States significantly transformed, as President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into a law. As a result of this Act, also known as Obamacare, America’s health care costs were lowered. In opposition to this act, the S.C.A.R.E. Party suggests that healthcare should instead be earned by each American. People should learn how to control their own lives, and should not be relying on help from the government for survival. Every person should learn to be independent. Every American should improve their position through their own efforts, people should not need assistance when it comes to their own personal life.
<br><br>The S.C.A.R.E. Party believes that the Affordable Care Act should be repealed because the law is causes damage to people’s lives. For example, this law forced every U.S. citizen to have healthcare insurance, since having healthcare became a requirement. And if someone did not purchase insurance, then that person had to pay a hefty fine. As a result, the S.C.A.R.E. Party sees this healthcare requirement as an infringement on people’s rights, as expressed in the Constitution. In 2013, 3 years after the Act was passed, about 54% of Americans did not support the Affordable Care Act. As a result, President Donald Trump began to come up with schemes to not only repeal the law but also to replace it. In order to make sure every American is raised to be independent, the Affordable Care Act should be repealed so that people are not required to have healthcare.
<br><br><b>Combatting Drugs</b>
<br><br>Over these past few years, the usage of drugs has increased dramatically since the regulations on drugs are not effective. From 2003 to 2013, the usage of heroin has doubled while deaths caused by heroin has quadrupled. In addition, opioids have also caused a crisis, as many rural areas are getting hit harder than the urban areas. When Americans use drugs, they are not only harming their own body and life, but also negatively influencing the way that the United States should properly function. 
<br><br>Which is why the S.C.A.R.E. Party believes that regulations on drug-related crimes should be strictly enforced. The United States’ government should apply severe, but also fair punishments on crimes that are related to drugs in order to make sure Americans are protected from harmful behaviors. One of these punishments should be mandatory prison sentences when robbery or murder is committed under the influence of drugs. And in the prisons, rehabilitation should be an opportunity for those who are willing to attempt it. Those who are seeking help in avoiding drugs should be given the chance to follow a better path in life. In families, the older generation is responsible for informing their children on drug hazards and should prevent their children from utilizing drugs. In addition, schools should also be providing drug treatments for those who need assistance in overcoming drug-related problems. Also, the punishment for drug traffickers must be death penalty because many innocent lives, including children, are taken. America should be striving for harsh consequences that follow right after drug-related crimes so that more and more people would thus try to avoid using drugs and committing crimes.
