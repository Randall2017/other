Regarding criminal justice, the S.C.A.R.E. party knows that putting America First means bringing justice to the innocent and giving closure to victims of crimes. We owe it to our founding fathers to uphold the ideals that our country was built upon. This includes being more clear with sentencing language, providing harsh punishment for those who have committed excessively violent and damaging crimes, as well as taking care of inmates and ensuring that they have a bright future after their release
<br><br><b>Limiting Federal Overreach</b>
<br><br>A fundamental pillar of the S.C.A.R.E. party platform is the division of responsibilities in the criminal justice sector between the federal government and state and local authorities. Federal government overreach has been an issue since Parliament created unnecessary taxes in the Revolutionary level, and the S.C.A.R.E. party is determined to limit the powers of the federal government in any way and give back more power to the states, who are more in tune with the needs of their populations. The number of regulations at the federal level that could get a person a fine or jail time is estimated to be anywhere from 100,000 to 300,000 (FNCL). Simply the fact that we don’t know how many there are tells us that we have a problem. Allowing state and local governments the jurisdiction that they are entitled to and deserve in regards to criminal justice would also ensure that citizens are actually aware of what can be considered a crime. Many of what is considered a crime or violation of the law is not inherently immoral by the average American’s standards, therefore most people would have no way of knowing what is a law and what isn’t. The federal government doesn’t allow ignorance of the law as an excuse, but instead of punishing people for their lack of understanding of a very complicated system, state and local governments should take control of educating their citizens about crime in order to reduce it. Because obviously, the federal government isn’t doing enough, even though they feel the need to enforce hundreds of thousands of vague regulations that could get people jail time. It is crucial that people are not wrongfully convicted simply because the federal government didn’t notify them about the laws in place.
<br><br><b>Capital Punishment</b>
<br><br>Capital punishment for especially heinous crimes has been a debate for over 300 years. In 2009, a study found that states that allowed child murderers to be eligible for the death penalty found a decrease of almost 20% of this crime in their state (Muhlhausen). The death penalty not only ensures that those who have chosen to take the lives of others are not able to do so again, but it sends a message to all criminals that their state will not tolerate incessant violence. Although opponents of the death penalty have stated that it’s not found anywhere in our founding documents, it’s mention in the 5th Amendment of our U.S. Constitution proves them wrong (5th Amendment). Others will say that it violates the motion against cruel and unusual punishment in the same document. However, as ruled in Gregg v. Georgia, the death penalty is not in fact in violation of the founding documents of our country (Cruel and Unusual Punishment). We believe that the death penalty is just and the “eye for an eye” mentality shows a strict hand to those thinking about harming others and our country. We will fix the problem by advocating for the death penalty and encouraging more states to adopt capital punishment.
<br><br><b>Vocational Training</b>
<br><br>Revolving around the energy crisis in our nation, more laborers will be needed as the jobs in the energy industry are expanded. Those serving jail time are an untapped resource and we as a nation shouldn’t let them fall through the cracks. Vocational education would allow those in jail to take advantage of their incarceration and allow the nation to take advantage of this population. We need more workers. A RAND Corporation report found that inmates who received vocational training were significantly more likely to find a job once they were released than their peers. In addition, the costs of incarceration are decreased, as recidivism rates are lower for inmates who received vocational training, as found in the same RAND report.
