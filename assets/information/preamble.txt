In recent months, the United States of America has been subjected to political turmoil and instability. Amidst the chaos, a strong, distinct new leadership has emerged to guide America on the right path: the Social Conservatism and Responsible Economics (S.C.A.R.E.) Party. The S.C.A.R.E. Party has a clear vision for success and prosperity in the United States.  
<br><br>Quite simply, above all else, the S.C.A.R.E. Party believes in one philosophy: America First.
<br><br>Putting America First means that our utmost priority is the security and success of American citizens. The United States government serves one people and one people only: the American people. When we put Americans First, and dedicate all of our efforts toward strengthening our own nation, America’s position as a global superpower is reinforced as well. This goal -- making America First in the world by prioritizing Americans First -- is expressed in the following principles that the S.C.A.R.E. Party is founded on:
<br><br>We, the S.C.A.R.E. Party, believe in traditional and moral values that all Americans should live by.
<br><br>We believe in a small government to ensure that the rights of the people are not infringed upon. 
<br><br>We believe in the opportunities and success of capitalism. 
<br><br>We believe in the freedoms of all Americans and the American Dream: the fundamental truth that in this great nation, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, or class, anybody who works hard can achieve success. 
<br><br>In the following pages, these principles and goals are expressed throughout our stances on several pressing issues. The S.C.A.R.E. Party has America’s best interests in mind and presents a promising future for the nation: an America that is powerful, free, and prosperous.
