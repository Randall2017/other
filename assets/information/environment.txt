The S.C.A.R.E. Party understands that at this time, climate change is possibly the biggest issue facing our world today. We want to help preserve our planet, make sure that it is healthy, and try to leave it in as best condition as we can for future generations. However, what is currently being done by the federal government regarding the conservation of our world, to end what they call the “ongoing environmental crisis,” is simply too much. For example, they believe that fossil fuels should stop being used as much as possible, and instead, they prefer to use renewable sources of energy such as hydropower and solar energy. While the S.C.A.R.E Party is not against the idea of renewable energy, and it recognizes the potential that it holds, it does not believe that it should be widely used at this time for a number of reasons. 
<br><br>First of all, 81% of the energy used in this country comes from the three main fossil fuels: oil, coal, and natural gas. Those last two resources listed are the ones used the most, both coming in right around 33%. On the other hand, the amount of renewable energy sources consumed in America takes up only a meager 13% of total energy usage. To continue with the current trend of hyper-regulating environmental programs and supporting more widespread use of renewable sources would be a deeply misguided action. Increasing solar power, hydropower, nuclear power, and other similar forms of energy would require a complete overhaul of the U.S. energy infrastructure, which would need an immense amount of government money to be completed. This would have a number of unfortunate effects, including a greater national debt, increased taxes to raise the funds needed for the effort, and a loss of millions of jobs in the fields of mining, oil refining, and industries centered around fossil fuels and their usage. Also, it would in turn raise energy prices, reducing the amount of Americans eligible to pay for energy. For these reasons, we think that the country should hold off on using renewable sources for now, and focus instead on developing strategies for their use which are better functioning and more cost-effective. Once these advancements are made, they can gradually be worked into American society. 
<br><br>Another reason for the continued use of fossil fuels instead of renewable energy resources is because there is still a bountiful amount of them lying unused in the earth. Across the globe, there are currently 1.65 trillion reserves of oil available to be used, and over time, that number will continue to grow. Even though the world uses up 11 billion tons of oil every year, and the reserves will not last forever, estimates show that with no new oil being obtained from this point forward, the amount of oil already obtained will last us into the 2050’s. With similar estimates calculated for natural gas and coal, it was predicted that the former will last into 2060, and the latter into 2088. That leaves us with an extremely large amount of time to develop new technologies concerning the use of renewable energy, as previously stated, and will allow our country and the world at large to sustain ourselves comfortably for the time being, while making advancements to be used in the future. At the same time, it will guarantee that people currently working in fossil fuel industries will not find themselves out of work, and will help low-income families keep their lights on, no matter what life throws at them.
<br><br>The final basis for the S.C.A.R.E Party’s stance on the environment is in the fact that every year, the world sees environmental progress towards a healthier planet. For example, efforts through the Clean Air Act have decreased the total amount of national emissions made up of six common pollutants by 70% since 1970, and air quality has greatly increased over time as well. However, one chemical that was not included in that six was carbon dioxide, which the S.C.A.R.E. Party is happy with, because it believes that all EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) regulations on carbon dioxide should be repealed, as that was something never intended by the act. 
<br><br>Overall, the S.C.A.R.E. Party recognizes the issues associated with the changing of our environment, and believes that something should be done about it. However, this should not occur right away, and America should rely on fossil fuels and our currently-prominent resources for now while we work to create change for the future.
